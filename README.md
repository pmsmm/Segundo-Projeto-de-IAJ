# Second Project of Artificial Inteligence for Games

Members that participated in the development of this project:
- Pedro Maria (Github: pmsmm);
- Gonçalo Marques (Github: goncasmage1);
- Inês Vilhena (Github: Ines-Vilhena);

This second project consisted in making a very efficient pathfinding algorithm that uses the Goal Bouding Technique and after that implementing a path smoothing algorithm to smooth the path returned by the pathfinding algorithm.

In order to achieve these goals the group implemented everything following several steps by the following order:
- Implementing the Traditional A* Algorithm;
- Implementing the Node Array A* Algorithm;
- Implementing The Goal Bounding;
- Smoothen The Paths returned by the Goal Bounding;

At the end of these 4 steps we had to compare each pathfinding algorithm and present the results to our teacher in order to evaluate performance.
